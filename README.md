# Invoice-to-Cash Workflow Automation

This project implements an **Invoice-to-Cash process automation** using **Python**, **LangGraph**, and **LangChain**.  
It converts a static business workflow  into an **automated backend system** that handles:

- Milestone-based billing plan generation
- Automatic invoice creation
- Payment tracking
- Escalation to finance/legal teams
- Full audit logging

---

## ðŸ“Œ Problem Statement

In many project-based businesses, invoicing and payment follow-up are **manual and error-prone**.  
Invoices are delayed, reminders are inconsistent, and overdue cases lack a clear escalation path.  

This system solves that by **automating** the process end-to-end, ensuring:
- Invoices go out immediately at milestone completion
- Overdue cases trigger reminders and escalation
- Full compliance via audit logs

---

## ðŸ”„ Workflow Overview

The workflow follows the original **Invoice & Payments System** PDF:

1. **Start Project (A)** â†’ Store client & project details.
2. **Define Billing Plan (B)** â†’ AI generates milestones & first invoice.
3. **Milestone Check (C)** â†’ Human-in-the-loop decision on completion.
4. **Invoice Logging & Dispatch (Eâ€“F)** â†’ Save in audit trail, send to client.
5. **Monitor Payments (G)** â†’ Check overdue status.
6. **Payment Verification (H)** â†’ Human check if payment received.
7. **If Paid (Iâ€“L)** â†’ Reconcile, mark milestone as paid, notify stakeholders.
8. **If Not Paid (Mâ€“Nâ€“O)** â†’ Send reminders, decide escalation.
9. **Escalation (Pâ€“Qâ€“R)** â†’ Finance or legal recovery if overdue >60 days.
